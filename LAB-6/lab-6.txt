pipe is a communication channel
for interprocess command
unidirectional communication
ex : ls -l | grep


till now we were creating unnamed pipe (after complition of 5 question)
using command : mkfifo <name of pipe>
to open manual page : man 2 mkfifo
// mkfifo is also library function
ls -l <name of pipe> // to locate pipe
tail -f <name of pipe> // to turn on read end of the pipe on terminal
// from new terminal
echo "adbjshdasd" > <pipe name> // will write from write end 

pipefd[0] -> read
pipefd[1] -> write
