execl ->list of arg (n argument will be pass)
execv -> array of arg
execve -> array of arg + env variables

execl("/bin/ls","ls","-l",NULL)
//("path","name of the process")

// dummy prog 
pf("hello")
execl("/bin/ls","ls","-l",NULL)
pf("hello")

// output of the dummy prog is:
hello 
* the output of the execl *
